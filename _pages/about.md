Hello! I am a senior Applied Science manager at Amazon Search, working on information retrieval and product search.  Prior to moving to search, I spent a few years in Alexa, working on Natural Language Understanding and conversational AI.  I am also a lecturer at the School of Information at UC Berkeley, teaching Fundamnetals of Machine Learning, and Introduction to Statistical Theory.  I got my Ph.D in Electrical Engineering and Computer Science from UC Berkeley. I also hold a Masters in Statistics and a Masters in Financial Engineering, both from UC Berkeley.  
Aside from my role at Amazon, I am collaborating with a few Ph.D. students at University of Washington for research on generative AI.
